# Quora Guided Project

Heya budding Data Scientists, today you are going to work along a guided project. As you all know Quora is a place to gain and share knowledge—about anything. 
It’s a platform to ask questions and connect with people who contribute unique insights and quality answers. 
This empowers people to learn from each other and to better understand the world.

## What are you going to do in this project ?
- Currently, Quora uses a Random Forest model to identify duplicate questions, you are expected  to tackle this natural language processing problem by 
  applying advanced techniques to classify whether question pairs are duplicates or not.



## Dataset Overview

This dataset is containing multiple questions collect from quora ranging from variety of topics. 
Each row consists of two sentences and a binary label that indicates to us whether the two questions were the same or not.
Also further data fields are mentioned as following -

    id - the id of a training set question pair
    qid1, qid2 - unique ids of each question (only available in train.csv)
    question1, question2 - the full text of each question
    is_duplicate - the target variable, set to 1 if question1 and question2 have essentially the same meaning, and 0 otherwise.
